		<h5>Bisenieks?  How am I supposed to pronounce that monstrosity?</h5>
		Bisenieks is a Latvian surname, and is easily pronounceable for those with a passing familiarity of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_language#Phonology">Latvian phonology</a>.  For those neither familiar with said phonology nor interested in learning it just for one name, it is pronounced <i>Biss</i> en yex [IPA: /b&#618;s&#949;nj&#949;ks/].

	<p>
		<h5>Why the kilt?</h5>
		I bought my first kilt because I thought that they looked comfortable.  I continue wearing kilts because I was right.
